openmrs-module-metadatamapping
==============================

Provides an easy & explicit way for metadata within a system (encounter types, location, etc.) to be mapped to external vocabularies.

The aim is to solve many of the problems around metadata management by making it easier for developers to refer to metadata, simplify the synchronisation of metadata cross systems, etc.
