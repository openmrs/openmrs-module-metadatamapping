conceptpubsub.addLocalMappings=Add local concept mappings?
conceptpubsub.addLocalMappings.description=Ensures that every concept you export has a mapping back to your local dictionary, and if not, tag that concept with its internal conceptId from your database. (This allows people to share concepts without central coordination, while still building up knowledge about concepts on different servers with identical meaning.)
conceptpubsub.conceptSource.description.line1=To do this, your database needs a Concept Source to represent the internal ids of concepts in your database. This Concept Source must be unique to your server. If you do not have a suitable Concept Source, you need to create one in order to be able to export Concepts.
conceptpubsub.conceptSource.description.line2=If you already have a Concept Source in your database that represents the internal conceptIds in your dictionary, choose it here:
conceptpubsub.ifNot=If not
conceptpubsub.configureImplementationId=configure implementation ID to create your Concept Source
conceptpubsub.configure.saved=Configuration saved successfully
